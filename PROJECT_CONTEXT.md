# EstiMATE iOS MVP - Project Context Document

## Overview
This document captures the complete context of the EstiMATE iOS MVP development session, including all design decisions, implementations, and iterations made.

## Project Background

### EstiMATE Vision
EstiMATE is an AI-powered home repair companion that helps anxious homeowners find trusted contractors. The core mission is to transform every home repair crisis into a moment of calm confidence, where homeowners feel supported, empowered, and never alone.

### Key Values
- **Empathy First, Technology Second**: Every feature starts with "How does this make someone feel?"
- **Transparency Builds Trust**: No hidden fees, no surprise charges, no contractor kickbacks
- **Accessibility is Non-Negotiable**: Great help shouldn't be a luxury

## Visual Identity Development

### Three Visual Identity Concepts Created

#### 1. **Calm & Trust** (`visual-identity-calm-trust.md`)
- **Primary Color**: Trust Blue (#2563EB)
- **Atmosphere**: Professional calm, like a well-organized office
- **Typography**: SF Pro Display with clean, spacious layouts
- **Best for**: Anxious homeowners seeking reassurance and professional competence

#### 2. **Modern Technology & Efficiency** (`visual-identity-modern-tech.md`)
- **Primary Color**: Electric Purple (#8B5CF6) with neon accents
- **Atmosphere**: High-tech precision with AI-forward design
- **Typography**: SF Pro Display Bold with SF Mono for data
- **Best for**: Tech-savvy users who value innovation and efficiency

#### 3. **Warmth & Human Connection** (`visual-identity-warm-human.md`) ✅ SELECTED
- **Primary Color**: Terracotta (#EA580C)
- **Atmosphere**: Neighborhood cafe warmth, personal and friendly
- **Typography**: SF Pro Rounded for approachability
- **Best for**: Users who prioritize human relationships and community

## Implementation Journey

### Phase 1: Initial "Midnight Leak" Flow
We first implemented a comprehensive emergency repair flow based on the MIDNIGHT_LEAK_FLOW_MVP.md document, featuring:
- Panic button entry point
- Camera integration for visual diagnosis
- AI analysis simulation
- Contractor matching with Mike Chen
- Full emotional support journey

### Phase 2: Pivot to Minimal Conversational UI
Based on the "EstiMATE: Minimal Home Screen User Flow (Happy Path Demo)" requirements, we rebuilt the entire UI to be:
- More conversational and chat-like
- Focused on empathy and encouragement
- Simplified with fewer screens
- Natural progression through the repair journey

## Current Implementation

### Technical Stack
- **Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Minimum iOS**: 15.0+ (implied by SwiftUI features used)
- **Architecture**: Single-view conversational interface
- **Dependencies**: None (pure SwiftUI)

### Key Files
1. **EstimateApp.swift** - Simplified app entry point
2. **ContentView.swift** - Complete conversational UI implementation
3. **Info.plist** - Updated with camera permissions
4. **Item.swift** - Removed (not needed for prototype)

### Color Palette (Implemented)
```swift
extension Color {
    static let warmCream = Color(red: 254/255, green: 243/255, blue: 199/255)
    static let terracotta = Color(red: 234/255, green: 88/255, blue: 12/255)
    static let forestGreen = Color(red: 5/255, green: 150/255, blue: 105/255)
    static let softWhite = Color(red: 255/255, green: 251/255, blue: 245/255)
    static let clayBrown = Color(red: 146/255, green: 64/255, blue: 14/255)
}
```

### User Flow (As Implemented)

1. **App Launch**
   - Warm gradient background
   - EstiMATE header
   - Welcome message: "Hi Amanda, what's going on at home?"

2. **User Interaction**
   - Text input for describing the problem
   - Example: "There's a weird puddle under my kitchen sink"

3. **EstiMATE Response**
   - Empathetic acknowledgment: "That sounds stressful! Want to show me a photo?"
   - Options: [Take Photo] [Just Describe]

4. **Photo Capture** (if selected)
   - Camera interface opens
   - User takes photo
   - Photo displays in chat

5. **Analysis**
   - Loading animation: "Analyzing your photo..."
   - 2-second simulated analysis

6. **Diagnosis**
   - "Looks like you might have a supply line leak—this is pretty common."
   - "Want to see what you can do yourself, or get more details?"
   - Options: [DIY Steps] [Tell Me More]

7. **Action Response**
   - DIY: Step-by-step instructions with numbered circles
   - Tell Me More: Detailed information about the issue

8. **Encouragement**
   - "You're doing great!"
   - "If you want to talk to a pro, just ask."

### Key UI Components

#### Message Types
- **WelcomeMessage**: Animated waving hand with greeting
- **UserMessage**: Right-aligned terracotta bubble
- **EstiMATEResponse**: Left-aligned with icon and supportive text
- **PhotoMessage**: User's photo with caption
- **AnalysisMessage**: Loading state with animated dots
- **DiagnosisMessage**: Green checkmark with findings
- **DIYInstructions**: Numbered steps with green circles
- **DetailedInfo**: Information rows with icons
- **EncouragementMessage**: Star icon with positive reinforcement

#### Input Area
- Dynamic based on conversation state
- Text field for initial input
- Context-appropriate buttons
- Auto-advances conversation flow

## Challenges Resolved

1. **Compilation Errors**: Added missing `import Combine` for ObservableObject
2. **Code Signing**: Documented solutions for provisioning profile errors
3. **UI Complexity**: Simplified from complex multi-screen flow to conversational interface

## Next Steps for Team

### Immediate Tasks
1. Test on physical device (once provisioning is resolved)
2. Add photo library option alongside camera
3. Implement real AI analysis (currently simulated)
4. Add more repair scenarios beyond sink leak

### Future Enhancements
1. Contractor connection flow
2. Payment integration
3. Chat persistence
4. Push notifications
5. Offline support
6. Multiple language support

### Design Considerations
1. Accessibility testing needed
2. Dark mode support could be added
3. iPad layout optimization
4. Landscape orientation handling

## Running the Project

### Requirements
- Xcode 14.0+
- iOS 15.0+ deployment target
- Camera access (for photo feature)

### Setup Steps
1. Open `Estimate.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select a simulator or device
3. For simulator: No code signing required
4. For device: Configure provisioning profile
5. Build and run (⌘R)

### Testing the Flow
1. Type any home issue in the text field (e.g., "leak under sink")
2. Choose to take a photo or just describe
3. If photo: Use simulator's camera or device camera
4. Watch the analysis animation
5. Choose DIY steps or more information
6. See the encouragement message

## Key Insights

1. **Empathy is the Differentiator**: Every interaction acknowledges feelings, not just problems
2. **Visual Diagnosis**: Show don't tell approach with camera integration  
3. **Transparency**: Clear information at each step
4. **Encouragement**: Positive reinforcement throughout
5. **Trust Building**: Professional presentation with warm personality
